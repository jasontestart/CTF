# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge

The first [SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/)
 that I participated in was in 2015. 
I started with less than a week left until the deadline so I did not finish it.
I have worked on at least part of every one since, but I have
not always finished nor completed a write-up. My write-ups are here:

 * [2015](testart-hhc2015.pdf) - Gnome in your Home
 * [2016](testart-hhc2016.pdf) - Santa's Business Card
 * [2017](testart-hhc2017.pdf) - Wintered (I got an [Honourable Mention](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2017/winners_answers.html) for this one!)
 * [2020](KringleCon3/KringleCon3-solution.pdf) - Kringlecon 3: French Hens

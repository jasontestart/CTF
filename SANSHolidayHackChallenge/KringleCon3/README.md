# KringleCon3: French Hens
This folder contains my [write-up](KringleCon3-solution.pdf) and code for the 
[SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2020](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/).  

I have also posted my code for select Objectives and terminal challenges from the challange.

I thought I would try Kubuntu 20.04 LTS to complete this challenge.
The setup Bash scripts are to download and install the required tools,
beyond the default install, to solve the challenges. 
I am sure any modern Debian-based distro will probably do.

I hope you find value in the content posted here.
